Web app project using Flask, TKinter and SQLite3 in Python

PYTHON
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Designed by GUIDO VAN ROSSUM and released in 1991.

FLASK
Flask is a web framework written in python. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. Developed by ARMIN RONACHER Released in 2010.

SQLITE3
Database software written in C. SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program. SQLite generally follows PostgreSQL syntax. Developed by D RICHARD HIPP.

TKINTER
Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.
